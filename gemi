Is it possible to update "gem" locally?

I have installed "gems" locally using :

gem install $1 -V -i $GEM_PATH

.. which did work for the 'rubygems-update' gem.

I was looking for a local option when running 'update_rubygems',
but didn't find one.

Otherwise I guess I'll wait a few days, until the host updates.

Btw,
